# Tests for a one-direction circle case with a single path and only one connecting edge

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g

added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge e23 from n2 to n3 in g
added edge e31 from n3 to n1 in g

path from n1 to n2:
n1 to n2 via e12

path from n1 to n3:
n1 to n2 via e12
n2 to n3 via e23

path from n3 to n1:
n3 to n1 via e31

path from n1 to n1:
